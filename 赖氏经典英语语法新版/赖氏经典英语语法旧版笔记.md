赖氏经典英语语法旧版笔记
--------------------

任何一个句子都是由主语 Subject 及动词 Verb 形成。

有时主语可以省略，而形成祈使句。这种祈使句句首为原形动词，之前省略了 You should 。祈使句变成否定形态时，要在原形动词前加 Don't 。

一般所见到的结构中，通常是以名词作主语，但除了名词之外，还可用代词、动名词或不定式短语、名词性从句、名词短语、表距离的地方副词短语等作主语。

用不定式作主语时，通常表示一种意愿、目的或未完成的事。例：To study abroad is my greatest desire.

不定式或动名词短语作主语时，往往会形成主语太长的现象，故通常均用代词 It 作形式主语，置于句首，而将真正的主要移至句尾。动名词移至句尾时，通常改为不定式短语。例：Collecting stamps is one of his hobbies. -> It is one of his hobbies to collect stamps.

有时我们亦可见到呗 It 代替的动名词短语移至句尾时，仍保留动名词形态而不变成不定式短语。但此种用法并不普遍，初学语法者宜尽量避免。佳 It is interesting to learn English.    可 It is interesting learning English.

下列句型则属例外情形，It 要代替动名词短语，不可使用不定式短语。It is no use + 动名词短语。例：It is no use asking him for help.

It is no use + 动名词短语 == It is useless + 不定式短语 == It is of no use + 不定式短语 == There is no [use|sense|point] + in + 动名词短语    It is useless to cry over split milk. == It is of no use to cry over split milk. == There is no use in crying over split milk.

名词性从句包括宾语从句、主语从句、表语从句、同位语从句，共有三种形式：that 从句、whether 从句、疑问词引导的从句。

whether 从句系由可用 yes/no 回答的一般疑问句变化而成。

疑问词从句系由疑问词 when、how、where、why、who、what、which 等引导的特殊疑问句变化而成。请注意，如果 who、what、which 为疑问代词，且在特殊疑问句中作主语，那么变成名词性从句时结构不变。例子：What did he write? -> what he wrote    What happened last night? -> what happened last night

名词性从句作主语：It remains to be seen whether he can do it.

名词性从句作及物动词 Transitive Verb 的宾语 Object：I know that he will go abroad in the near future.    I wonder whether he has finished the work.    I don't know how he'll handle it.

名词性从句作介词 Preposition 的宾语时，只能用 whether 从句或疑问词引导的名词性从句作宾语。非要用 that 从句时，其补救方法如下：1. 介词 + the fact + that 从句。如此，就可用 the fact 作介词的宾语，而 that 从句就成了 the fact 的同位语。I am sure of the fact that the team has won the game. 2. 保留介词，不加 the fact，但介词之后的 that 从句要先除去 that，再将 that 后的主语变为所有格，最后把动词变成动名词。× I am worried about that he plays around all day. -> √ I am worried about his playing around all day. 注意：2.1 that 从句有助动词 do、does、did、will、would 时，予以去掉即可。× I am worried about that he doesn't study. -> √ I am worried about his not studying. × I am sure of that the team will win the game -> √ I am sure of the team's winning the game. 2.2 that 从句有助动词 may | can 时，变化为 may -> being likely to | can -> being able to 。× I am happy about that he may come. -> √ I am happy about his being likely to come. × I am sure of that he can do it. -> √ I am sure of his being able to do it. 3. be + adj. + that 从句。也就是去掉介词，将 that 从句放在形容词后面，作其宾语。× I am worried about that he plays around all day. -> √ I am worried that he plays around all day. × I am sure of that the team has won the game. -> √ I am sure that the team has won the game. 注意：以上三种补救方法 1 和 3 最为普遍，但 2 则是常考的一种句型。有时介词之后亦可直接接 that 从句，而不需 the fact，形成惯用语。He is talented in that(in that == because 因为) he can speak five different languages. He is nice except that(只可惜，除了...) sometimes he lies. Notwithstanding that(notwithstanding == despite the fact that == in spite of the fact that 尽管) he is nice, I don't like him.
